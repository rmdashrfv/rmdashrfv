### Ex-Soldier Ex-Correctional Officer Tech Lead

My name is Michael Law and I'm a software engineer and instructor in New York City. My latest work is a new food rewards platform called [Vittles](https://partners.eatvittles.com). My previous work includes 4 years of delivering instruction, curriculum creation and technical writing, freelance projects ranging from simple website maintenance to full-on product design and creation, engineering on the infrastructure team at a large tech company, as well as creating and selling my own event management software.

My interests and technical experience include writing fully-featured software for front end, back end, desktop, Chrome & Firefox extensions, and iOS & Android apps. My past experiences include being a gymnastics and cheer coach, soldier, and correctional officer.

For recruiters, I mean this in the most respectful way possible: if no one has ever been maimed or killed in the role we are discussing, please do not ask me if I can handle it. I can. Trust me.
