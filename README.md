### The journey of 1000 steps begins with a single mile

My name is Michael Law and I'm a software engineer and instructor in New York City. My latest work is a new food rewards platform called [Vittles](https://eatvittles.com), which is quite possibly the best food rewards app ever created! My previous work includes over 2 years of delivering instruction, curriculum creation and technical writing, freelance projects ranging from simple website maintenance to full-on product design and creation, engineering on the infrastructure team at a large tech company, as well as creating and selling my own event management software.

My interests and technical experience include writing fully-featured software for front end, back end, desktop, Browser extensions, iOS, and Android. My past experiences include being a gymnastics and cheer coach, soldier, and correctional officer.

For recruiters, I mean this in the most respectful way possible: if no one has ever been maimed or killed in the role we are discussing, please do not ask me if I can handle it. I can. Trust me.

### Vittles: Food Rewards & Takeout
Vittles launches March 30, 2022! I'm doing an early testing phase to ensure things go as smoothly as possible. You can offer to be a tester and get Vittles VIP from day one by emailing me at [rmdashrfv@hey.com](mailto:rmdashrfv@hey.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20help%20test%20Vittles!)!
