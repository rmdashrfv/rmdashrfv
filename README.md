### Ex-Soldier Ex-Correctional Officer Tech Lead

My name is Michael Law and I'm a software engineer and instructor in New York City. My latest work is a new food rewards platform called [Vittles](https://eatvittles.com). My previous work includes 4 years of delivering instruction, curriculum creation and technical writing, freelance projects ranging from simple website maintenance to full-on product design and creation, engineering on the infrastructure team at a large tech company, as well as creating and selling my own event management software.

My interests and technical experience include writing fully-featured software for front end, back end, desktop, Browser extensions, iOS, and Android. My past experiences include being a gymnastics and cheer coach, soldier, and correctional officer.

For recruiters, I mean this in the most respectful way possible: if no one has ever been maimed or killed in the role we are discussing, please do not ask me if I can handle it. I can. Trust me.

### Vittles = (Grubhub - service fees) + rewards + Too Good To Go
Vittles is quite possibly the best food rewards app ever created! In simplest terms, think of it as Grubhub without the service fees, with built-in rewards, plus everything that Too Good To Go can do. That means you earn points on every order placed on Vittles and you can use those points in combination any other rewards you find on the platform. Additionally, you can find amazing discounts and help fight food waste by reserving "surprise bags" of surplus food from restaurants (and even use your points to purchase surprise bags, further saving money)!

All of this comes with [the most carefully designed user experience in online ordering](https://medium.com/vittles/a-food-app-that-works-better-for-everyone-33f2b3643e7): dietary restriction search, no paid listings, more transparency with virtual kitchens, and much more!

The initial production test is complete and everything went better than expected! You can offer to be a tester and get Vittles VIP by emailing me at [rmdashrfv@hey.com](mailto:rmdashrfv@hey.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20help%20test%20Vittles!)!
