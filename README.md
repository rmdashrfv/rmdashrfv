My name is Michael Law and I'm a software engineer and instructor in New York City. My latest work is a bookmarking & productivity tool called [TabMagic](https://tabmagic.app) â€“ It lets you bookmark tabs and links easily by using a browser-wide Panel. Storing everything in custom workspaces and allows you to create "Magic Pages" that enable you to easily share links and notes with your team! Check out the features and shortcuts [here](https://tabmagic.app#shortcuts)!

[Vittles](https://partners.eatvittles.com) is a food ordering app centered around rewards and a top-shelf user experience that big tech companies can't compete with at the city/local level. I do all system/UI design, copywriting ([the blog](https://blog.eatvittles.com)), social media, and sales for it.  My previous work includes 4 years of delivering instruction, curriculum creation and technical writing, freelance projects ranging from simple website maintenance to end-to-end product design and creation, engineering on the infrastructure team at a large tech company, as well as creating and selling my own event management software.

My interests and technical experience include writing fully-featured software for front end, back end, desktop, Chrome & Firefox extensions, and iOS & Android apps. My past experiences include being a gymnastics and cheer coach, soldier, and correctional officer so assume I'm up for any role if it doesn't inolve the risk of getting maimed or killed. If that risk *is* involved lets talk anyway because I might still be interested.
