My name is Michael Law and I'm a programmer & designer in NYC. My latest work is a productivity app for macOS called [Monarch](https://monarchlauncher.com). It allows you to work significantly faster and navigate more efficiently, saving you multiple hours of work time every week. Check out the features [here on the blog](https://blog.monarchlauncher.com/introducing-monarch-665482f26db9) and if you like it, be sure to email me for student discounts at [rmdashrfv@hey.com](x)

I enjoy the process of working on products end to end, from wireframe to deployment, and have built software for every major platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Android and iOS. Still going and more planned!

Here's other stuff I've worked on:
- [TabMagic](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabmagic-bookmark-tab-man/npgdnccnohhbnkiligkdfahfpekgjjka) - Bookmark tabs and links easily by using a browser-wide UI, and annotate & share them with teammates.
- [Amethyst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rmdashrfv.amethyst) - Real-time static typing analysis for Python. Perfect for learning and experimenting with new functions or APIs.
