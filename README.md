My name is Michael Law and I'm a programmer, designer and the creator of [Monarch](https://monarchlauncher.com). You can check out Monarch and other things I'm doing [here on the blog](https://blog.monarchlauncher.com/introducing-monarch-665482f26db9).

I enjoy working on products end to end, from wireframe to deployment, and have built software for every major platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Android and iOS. Still going and more planned! Previously, I worked as a platform engineer and created an event ticketing platform. Currently, I'm working to release a book I'm writing on ReactJS and design.

Here's other stuff I've worked on:
- [TabMagic](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabmagic-bookmark-tab-man/npgdnccnohhbnkiligkdfahfpekgjjka) - Bookmark tabs and links easily by using a browser-wide UI, and annotate & share them with teammates.
- [Amethyst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rmdashrfv.amethyst) - Real-time static typing analysis for Python. Perfect for learning and experimenting with new functions or APIs.
